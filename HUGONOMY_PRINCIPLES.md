# VibeAI Principles — Human-First AI Collaboration

**A Steward-First Approach**

VibeAI is built on a simple belief:
> **AI should support human clarity — not quietly erode it.**

These principles govern how VibeAI is designed, built, and released. They are not marketing claims. They are **constraints**.

---

## 1. **Human Sovereignty Comes First**
VibeAI never makes decisions for you.
- You remain the sole decision-maker at all times
- VibeAI reflects patterns and signals — it does not tell you what to think
- You can override, pause, or disable VibeAI instantly

AI exists to assist your understanding, not replace your judgment.

---

## 2. **Consent Is Required — Always**
VibeAI does nothing without your permission.
- AI assistance is opt-in, not assumed
- Opt-out is always one click away
- No hidden "always on" modes
- No dark patterns that push broader consent

If you don't want help, VibeAI stays silent.

---

## 3. **Privacy Is the Default**
VibeAI is designed to work **locally in your browser**.
- No external network calls
- No telemetry or analytics
- No tracking
- No cloud sync by default
- No background monitoring

Your conversations stay yours.

---

## 4. **Reflection, Not Judgment**
VibeAI does **not** judge people.

It will not:
- Label anyone as lying or manipulative
- Infer intent or character
- Shame, pressure, or moralize

It may surface **factual patterns or contradictions**, but interpretation is always yours.

---

## 5. **No Manipulation — Ever**
VibeAI will never:
- Optimize persuasion
- Recommend deceptive language
- Exploit fear, shame, urgency, or emotional vulnerability
- Try to "push" you toward an outcome

If a feature feels coercive, it does not belong in VibeAI.

---

## 6. **Transparency Over Power**
You should always understand what VibeAI is doing.
- AI-assisted actions are clearly labeled
- There is no hidden reasoning or silent optimization
- You can see when VibeAI is active — and when it isn't

Nothing happens behind your back.

---

## 7. **Sensitive Contexts Are Handled Carefully**
In high-risk situations, VibeAI steps back by default.

These include:
- Personal relationships
- Workplace power imbalances
- Immigration discussions
- Health or disability contexts
- Legal matters
- Conversations involving minors

Additional consent is required before assistance resumes.

---

## 8. **You Can Verify Our Claims**
VibeAI's privacy promises are testable.

Advanced users can:
- Open DevTools
- Confirm no external network traffic
- Inspect storage usage (local only)
- Review open documentation

Trust should be inspectable, not assumed.

---

## 9. **Known Platform Limitations**
VibeAI supports ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot across major browsers.

**Known limitation:**
Microsoft Edge currently restricts third-party extensions from running on Copilot within Edge. Workarounds are documented transparently.

---

## 10. **This Is a Stewardship Project**
VibeAI is not built to maximize engagement, extraction, or dependence.

It is built to:
- Preserve clarity
- Respect boundaries
- Protect dignity

We establish limits **before** scale because boundaries added after power emerges are rarely honest.

---

## In Short

- ✅ VibeAI runs locally
- ✅ It does not watch you
- ✅ It does not judge you
- ✅ It does not manipulate you
- ✅ It exists to help you notice — not obey
