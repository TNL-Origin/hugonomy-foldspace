# 🧠 About VibeAI FoldSpace

Understanding the vision, technology, and team behind emotional intelligence for AI chat.

## 🌌 What is VibeAI FoldSpace?

VibeAI FoldSpace is a Chrome extension that brings **emotional awareness** to your AI conversations. It analyzes the emotional tone of your chats in real-time and displays it through an elegant, non-intrusive HUD overlay.

Unlike traditional sentiment analysis tools, VibeAI uses the proprietary **HugoScore algorithm** to detect nuanced emotional states: Calm, Urgent, Reflective, Dissonant, and Resonant. These aren't just "positive" or "negative" - they represent the actual emotional texture of your conversation.

### Why "FoldSpace"?

The name comes from the concept of "folding" emotional space to make invisible dynamics visible. Just as Frank Herbert's *Dune* describes folding space to travel vast distances, VibeAI "folds" emotional space to make distant emotional patterns immediately perceivable.

## 🧪 The HugoScore Algorithm

**HugoScore** is a proprietary emotional tone analysis algorithm developed by Joseph Tingling. It measures emotional coherence and intensity on a scale of 0-100.

### How It Works

1. **Message Analysis**: Extracts linguistic patterns, emotional markers, and conversational flow
2. **Tone Mapping**: Maps to one of 5 emotional states (Calm, Urgent, Reflective, Dissonant, Resonant)
3. **Intensity Calculation**: Determines the strength of the emotional state (0-100)
4. **Visualization**: Renders the result as a glowing emoji glyph in the HUD

### The 5 Emotional States

| State | HugoScore Range | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 🌊 **Calm** | 65-75 | Peaceful, steady, low-energy, balanced |
| ⚡ **Urgent** | 75-85 | Action-driven, time-sensitive, high-energy |
| 🔮 **Reflective** | 60-70 | Thoughtful, analytical, contemplative |
| ⚙️ **Dissonant** | 50-60 | Conflicted, uncertain, tension detected |
| ✨ **Resonant** | 85-100 | Peak coherence, flow state, optimal alignment |

**Patent Notice**: The HugoScore algorithm is protected by U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/856,714.

## 🏛️ What is Hugonomy?

**Hugonomy** is a framework for building emotional infrastructure for human-AI collaboration. The name combines "Hugo" (human) + "nomy" (governance/structure).

### Core Principle: Emotional Sovereignty

Emotional Sovereignty is the idea that **individuals should have full ownership and awareness of the emotional dynamics in their AI interactions**.

This means:
- 🔒 **Privacy**: Emotional data never leaves your device
- ✋ **Consent**: Clear opt-in with full transparency
- 👁️ **Visibility**: Emotional states made visible and actionable
- 🎛️ **Control**: Users decide what to track and how

### Why Hugonomy Matters

As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, the emotional dimension of human-AI interaction becomes critical. We spend hours chatting with AI assistants, often without awareness of how these interactions affect our emotional state.

Hugonomy provides the tools to:
- Recognize when conversations become unproductive (Dissonant)
- Identify moments of peak clarity (Resonant)
- Maintain emotional balance in AI-mediated work
- Build healthier relationships with AI tools

VibeAI FoldSpace is the first real-world product built on Hugonomy principles.
