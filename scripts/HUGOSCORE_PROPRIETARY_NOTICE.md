# HugoScore Engine - Proprietary Notice

## Why This File Is Not Included

The **HugoScore algorithm** (`hugoscore-engine.js`) is **proprietary intellectual property** protected by U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/856,714.

### What is HugoScore?

HugoScore is the core emotional tone analysis algorithm that powers VibeAI FoldSpace. It analyzes conversational patterns to detect emotional states (Calm, Urgent, Reflective, Dissonant, Resonant) and calculates emotional coherence on a scale of 0-100.

### Why It's Excluded from Public Repo

To protect the patent-pending intellectual property, the HugoScore engine implementation is not included in this public repository. The algorithm represents years of research into human-AI emotional dynamics and is the key innovation behind VibeAI FoldSpace.

### How VibeAI Still Works

VibeAI FoldSpace includes a **compiled/obfuscated version** of the HugoScore engine in the distributed extension. Users can:
- ✅ Install and use the extension normally
- ✅ Verify all analysis happens locally (no network calls)
- ✅ Inspect all other source code for transparency
- ❌ Cannot view/modify the HugoScore algorithm implementation

### For Researchers & Developers

If you're interested in:
- Academic collaboration on emotional AI research
- Licensing the HugoScore algorithm for your project
- Understanding the technical approach (high-level)
