Hugonomy Protective License (HPL-1.0) — Controlled Data Clause

### Controlled Data Clause – Emotional Lexicons

The emotional lexicon files distributed with this software
(toneMap_youth.json, toneMap_pro.json, and any derivatives)
are classified as Controlled Data under the Hugonomy Protective License (HPL-1.0).

These files are provided solely for personal or academic evaluation during
the beta period. Redistribution, modification, training of machine-learning
models, or any commercial use of these lexicon datasets is strictly prohibited
without a written license agreement from Hugonomy Systems or Joseph Duane Tingling.

All rights, title, and interest in the structure, phrasing, emotional mappings,
and metadata of these lexicons remain the exclusive property of Hugonomy Systems.

Patent Pending — USPTO Application No. 63/856,714

Notes:
- This file intentionally combines the permissive MIT license for the codebase
  with an additional HPL-1.0 clause that controls redistribution and commercial
  use of the provided lexicon datasets during beta. The HPL clause is intended
  as a protective legal notice and deterrent; consult legal counsel to convert
  this into a stand-alone enforceable license document if required.
